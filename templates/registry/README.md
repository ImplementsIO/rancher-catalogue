# Registry

## Topology

This catalogue item consists of a Registry, and the Portus web UI for 
authentication.  There is also a MySQL database for storage.  The Portus
service may be multi-instance if required, as may the Registry.

## Backing Store

A shared filesystem is required to host the Registry, and also the 
MySQL database.
